\section{Question 1 - The Convolutional Model}
\subsection{}
Describe in words what convolution is, and how it differs from correlation.
\subsection{}
The convolutional model of the seismic trace states that the trace we record is the result of the earth's response convolved with the source wavelet the recording system and some noise. Show an equation which describes this, and label each term.
\subsection{}
The earth's response consists of a range of different signals, including the direct wave, refracted wave and reflected wave.  Show an equation which includes these signals in the convolutional model.
\section{Question 2 - The Direct Wave}
\subsection{}
What is the direct wave?
\subsection{}
Assuming a velocity of 400m/s, how long does it take the direct wave to travel from the source to reciever shown in Figure 1?
\subsection{}
Attenuation of waves occurs for a number of reasons. One reason is that of spherical divergence. Describe the basic cause of amplitude loss due to spherical divergence.
\subsection{}
Assuming that the attenuation due to spherical divergence has a coefficient of two, and the source has unit amplitude, calculate the amplitude of the direct wave at the geophone in Figure 1.
\section{Question 3 - The Refracted Wave}
\subsection{}
What is a refracted wave?
\subsection{}
What is the critical angle in for the source-reciever geometry shown in Figure 1?
\subsection{}
What is the travel time for the geometry shown in Figure 1?
\section{Question 4 - The Reflected Wave}
\subsection{}
Calculate the travel time of the reflected wave for the model shown in Figure 1. Assume straight rays.
\subsection{}
Assuming a unit source amplitude, calculate the amplitude of the reflected wave at the geophone due to transmission and reflection coefficients.  Assume zero offset coefficients.
\par~\\
Discuss when it might and might not be appropriate to use the zero offset assumption.

\section{Question 5 - Seismic Gathers}
\subsection{}
What is the difference between a shot gather, a reciever gather and  CMP gather? Draw a rough diagram of each.  
\subsection{}
What are CMP gathers useful for? Why?
\subsection{}
What is fold?
\section{Question 6 - Normal Moveout}
\subsection{}
Calculate the zero offset traveltime for the reflection event in question 4.
\subsection{}
Wavelet stretching is caused by the non-linear NMO correction. Discuss the impact of stretch and a potential mitigation strategy.
\section{Question 7 - Stacking}
\subsection{}
What is stacking?  
\subsection{}
What is the signal to noise ratio improvement for a CMP gather with a fold of $n$?
\section{Question 8 - Noise attenuation}
\subsection{}
The refracted wave calculated in question 3 is often considered noise.  What is one method that can be used to remove the refracted wave? Discuss the steps required in this method.
\subsection{}
Often we want to enhance coherant events whilst attenuating random events. Discuss one method for achieving this. Discuss the potential negatives associated with this method.

\end{itemize}

\[ {t_x}^2 = {t_0}^2 + \frac{x^2}{v^2}\]
